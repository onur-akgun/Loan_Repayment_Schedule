# Loan_Repayment_Schedule
ScheduleBuilder build a String that represents the amortization schedule of loan balances over a period of years.

A New CarObjectives:Write Java statements to implement the counting looping structureWrite Java statements to implement the conditional looping structurePractice introductory Defensive Programming by enforcing preconditionsOverview:This week the text introduces counting and conditional loopingstructures.  Basically put, we'll use acounting loop (for) when we knowat design timethe exact number of iterations the loop body shouldrun.  By contrast if the numberof iterations of the loop bodyis determinedat run time, then we'll use aconditional loop (either while or do/while).  Please know thatpart of your grade will be based on whichloop structure you choose to implement – be sure you know the difference andwhen each isappropriate.We're going to practice writingboth types of loops in our exercise as we attempt to build anamortization schedule for the payments on a car or house loan.We'll use conditional loops to force ouruser to enter a number within a specified range before moving on to use the counted loop to build thetable.   
The class you will develop is namedScheduleBuilder, which will keep track of theLoanobjectunder consideration and the actual table itself.  In order to allow this object to build the table, we'lldefine methods to:Build the results tableGet the actual table
